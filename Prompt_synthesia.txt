Project Title: The Individual Brain Project (IBP): A Knowledge Graph & AI Framework for Precision Neuroimaging

Video Goal: Create a simple, illustrative animated video (approximately 60-90 seconds) summarizing the 'Individual Brain Project (IBP)'. The style should be clean, professional, 2D infographic animation with a logical flow from problem to solution to impact. Focus on clarity. Use a professional and engaging color palette. Ensure smooth transitions between scenes and that text overlays are concise and easily readable.

Scene Breakdown:

Scene 1: The Opening Challenge

Visuals:
Start with a prominent, rounded rectangle or cloud shape at the top left labeled: "Precision neuroimaging for robust biomarkers".
An arrow should point from this to a larger, distinct colored (e.g., light red) rectangular box to its right labeled: "Challenges:".
Below "Challenges," display two interconnected problem areas as distinct rounded rectangles:
Left sub-box: "(i) Fragmentation of research efforts" (Perhaps visualize with small, scattered, disconnected circular icons below it).
Right sub-box: "(ii) Increased degrees of freedom" (Perhaps visualize with tangled or diverging arrow pathway icons below it).
Text Overlay (briefly appearing as elements are shown): "Challenge: Fragmentation & Reproducibility in Precision Neuroimaging."
Scene 2: Identifying the Need

Visuals: Arrows from both "Fragmentation" and "Increased degrees of freedom" boxes should converge downwards to a dashed-line rectangular box labeled: "Need for systematic, integrated framework". This box should appear centrally below the challenges.
Text Overlay (with the "Need" box): "A systematic framework is essential."
Scene 3: Proposing the Solution - Individual Brain Project (IBP)

Visuals: An arrow should lead down from the "Need for systematic, integrated framework" box to a prominent, solid-colored (e.g., blue) rectangular box labeled: "Proposed solution: Individual Brain Project (IBP)". This IBP box should be central.
Text Overlay (with the IBP box): "Solution: The Individual Brain Project."
Scene 4: The Core - Curated Knowledge Graph (KG-IBP)

Visuals: An arrow leads down from the "IBP" box to a large, central, distinct colored (e.g., light green) rounded rectangle labeled "Curated Knowledge Graph (KG-IBP)".
Inside this KG-IBP box, include smaller text elements or icons to represent:
"Nodes = Studies (Metadata, data characteristics, methodological details)" (Perhaps use a document icon).
"Edges = Relationships (Similarity, Benchmarks)" (Perhaps use interconnected lines or a simple graph icon).
Text Overlay (with KG-IBP box): "Core: KG-IBP â€“ Curated graph of studies & methods."
Scene 5: Building & Enriching KG-IBP (Work Packages 1 & 2)

Visuals:
To the left of the "KG-IBP" box, show a rectangular box labeled "WP 1 Systematic review and curation" (perhaps with a database or document stack icon). An arrow should point from this WP1 box into the KG-IBP box.
Below WP1, another box labeled "WP 2 Benchmarking and relationship mapping" (perhaps with a scale/balance icon or graph icon). An arrow should point from this WP2 box into the KG-IBP box.
Text Overlay (appearing sequentially or together): "Building the KG: WP1 (Curation) & WP2 (Benchmarking)."
Scene 6: Leveraging KG-IBP - Project Outputs (Work Packages 3, 4, & 5)

Visuals: Arrows should emerge from the right side of the "KG-IBP" box leading to three distinct output boxes (e.g., light yellow), each with a simple icon:
Top output box: "WP 3 Method development and implementation" (icon: a lightbulb with gears, or a new branching pathway).
Middle output box: "WP 4 Open Individual Brain Toolbox" (icon: a toolkit, gears, or an open box symbol).
Bottom output box: "WP 5 Context-aware AI method recommender" (icon: an AI/robot head with a speech bubble, or a brain with connecting nodes).
Text Overlay (appearing with outputs): "Key Outputs: New Methods (WP3), Open Toolbox (WP4), AI Recommender (WP5)."
Scene 7: Overall Impact

Visuals: Arrows from the three output boxes (WP3, WP4, WP5) and/or directly from the KG-IBP box should converge downwards to a final, impactful bar or box (e.g., darker green) at the bottom of the screen. This box should be labeled: "Impact: Cohesive and integrated research efforts, fostering robust and impactful precision neuroimaging research". The visual could show scattered elements becoming organized or an upward trend.
Text Overlay (on the Impact box or as a final statement): "Fostering robust, impactful precision neuroimaging."
Scene 8: End Screen (Optional)

Visuals: IBP Title.
Text Overlay: "The Individual Brain Project."
General Instructions for AI:

Ensure a clear visual hierarchy and flow, generally top-to-bottom and left-to-right where logical.
Use simple, clean icons that are easily understandable.
Transitions between scenes should be smooth (e.g., fade, wipe, or elements morphing).
Keep animations simple and illustrative, serving to highlight the connections and flow of information.
Text should be on screen long enough to be read easily.
If music is an option, choose something neutral, professional, and subtly optimistic. No voiceover is needed for a simple version.
